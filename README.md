HR Functional Enhancements — Missing Best Practices

Below are functional gaps and recommended features aligned with modern HR recruitment standards:

🔍 Candidate Scoring Enhancements

Weighted Skill Category Scoring — Split skills into technical, soft, and domain categories with separate match percentages.

Experience Timeline Validation — Detect gaps or overlapping roles using NLP + regex temporal extraction.

Certifications Match — Recognize relevant certifications (AWS, PMP, etc.) and weigh them like micro-qualifications.

Role-Level Calibration — Adjust scoring logic depending on job seniority (e.g., “junior” roles emphasize learning potential).

🧭 HR Analytics & Diversity Insights

Bias Detection Module — Check for gendered wording or biased role phrasing in JD or CV (inclusive hiring compliance).

Diversity Score — Incorporate anonymized background variety as a non-weighted data insight (for HR reporting).

📊 Recruiter Workflow Tools

Candidate Comparison Dashboard — Already present, but could show strength/weakness radar heatmaps per role competency.

Automated Shortlist Report — Export top matches with gap-analysis and suggested interview topics.

Feedback Loop Integration — Let recruiters manually tag accepted/rejected candidates to fine-tune the weighting model (semi-supervised learning).

💬 Interview Preparation Tools

Behavioral Question Generator 2.0 — Use candidate weak areas to generate STAR-based interview prompts (“Tell me about a time…”).

Cultural Fit Predictor — Analyze tone and phrasing in CV summary to match company values or leadership principles.

⚙️ Data Quality & Compliance

GDPR Compliance Checks — Flag personal identifiers in CVs (address, birth date, etc.) for anonymization.

Document Quality Scoring — Penalize low-quality scans or missing structured data (incomplete PDFs).
